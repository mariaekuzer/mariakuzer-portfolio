        <h4 class="po-subtitle">The Challenge</h4>
        <p class="po-text">Make a short typographic video based on an example of Concrete Poetry. The video should focus
            on exploring the ideas and structures that present in the original poem, but use the added dimensions of
            time, movement and sound, in order to create an original work. The poem was chosen from the selection
            provided by the teachers.</p>

    <!-- Main content of the project -->
    <div class="content">

        <p class="po-text">The concept of the poem’s animation relates with the idea of spring. This was elaborated by
            exploring the meaning of the poem in cause — Forsythia by Mary Ellen Solt — and also the meaning of spring.
            For this last one, I found interesting to explore an excerpt from the chapter “A False Spring” from A
            Moveable Feast by Ernest Hemingway.</p>

        <p class="po-text" style="margin-top: 60px;">Forsythia represents the arrival of good weather, the blossoming of
            flowers and everything
            good that spring
            brings with it.
            On the other hand, the American author portrays spring as a promised happiness, but that ends up to fail and
            be unfulfilled.</p>

        <p class="po-text">The poem animation intends to portrait spring and its forthcoming characteristics as a
            supposed prosperity time, but also an unfulfilled one.</p>
