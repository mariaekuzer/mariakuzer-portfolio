        <h4 class="po-subtitle">My Role</h4>
        <p class="po-text">I was one of the 3 members that led the Product Design of this project.</p>

        <h4 class="po-subtitle">Main Tasks</h4>
        <ul class="po-text">
            <li>Serve users through tangible solutions</li>
            <li>Develop an experience for users</li>
            <li>Test ideas in high fidelity and evaluate user experience to affect strategy</li>
            <li>Understand cognitive psychology, heuristics and research; <br>and the behaviour and motivations of users
            </li>
            <li>Create mockups and flows for the user interface</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="po-subtitle">The Challenge</h4>
        <p class="po-text">Create an application prototype for mobile devices which content should be addressed in
            someway to Europeana
            — an european digital cultural heritage repository. We also had to came up with the problem and goal for
            this project.</p>

        <h4 class="po-subtitle">The Outcome</h4>
        <p class="po-text">An end-to-end program that helped people with mental health live healthier, happier lives
            through monitoring
            and the power of habit.</p>

        <p class="po-text">We started by having a brainstorming session <b style="font-weight: 800;">to explore
                problems</b> for our project. Each team member wrote down words that came to mind on a Post-It note. We
            repeated the process several times, resulting in a few ideas. After, we observed some similarities between
            the generated ideas and decided to group them by themes.</p>
        <img class="po-image-two" src="images/rise/rise2.png" alt="Rise, Health App">
        <p class="po-text">Within the themes we got, we chose to move forward with health. Since it is a theme we had
            never worked on
            before, we thought it would be a good challenge to develop our research and design thinking skills. Within
            the various areas of health, we decided to follow with <b>mental health</b>.</p>

        <!-- Research -->
        <h4 class="po-subtitle">1. Research</h4>
        <p class="po-text">In recent years, there has been increasing acknowledgment of the importance of mental health
            in <b>achieving
                global development</b> goals. According to World Health Organization:</p>
        <img class="po-image-two" src="images/rise/rise3.png" alt="Rise, Health App">
        <p class="po-text">After research it became clear what the problem to work on was and, consequently, its goal.
        </p>

        <h5 class="po-subtitle">Define</h5>
        <p class="po-text">We proceeded to define our problem, goals and make a proposal.</p>
        <img class="po-image-three" src="images/rise/rise4.png" alt="Rise, Health App">

        <!-- Synthesis -->
        <h4 class="po-subtitle">2. Synthesis </h4>
        <p class="po-text">Here we started generating ideas - such as functionalities, users and stakeholders, and user
            flow.</p>
        <img class="po-image-three" src="images/rise/rise5.png" alt="Rise, Health App">

        <h5 class="po-subtitle">User experience goals</h5>
        <img class="po-image-two" src="images/rise/rise6.png" alt="Rise, Health App">

        <h5 class="po-subtitle">Stakeholders and Users</h5>
        <img class="po-image-two" src="images/rise/rise7.png" alt="Rise, Health App">

        <h5 class="po-subtitle">Storyboard</h5>
        <p class="po-text">To better understand the user's context, we created a possible scenario and a storyboard to
            map out the intended experience and visualize key touch points.</p>
        <img class="po-image-one" style="margin-left: 0;" src="images/rise/rise8.png" alt="Rise, Health App">

        <!-- Ideation -->
        <h4 class="po-subtitle">3. Ideation </h4>
        <h5 class="po-subtitle">Wireframes</h5>
        <p class="po-text">Then we proceeded to create an initial version of the app screens. During this process, we
            discussed ideas and alternatives — we listed the tasks for the user and created a navigation system between
            screens.</p>
        <img class="po-image-two" src="images/rise/rise9.png" alt="Rise, Health App">

        <h5 class="po-subtitle">User flow</h5>
        <p class="po-text">After we created user flows and wireframes to capture the application's tasks.</p>
        <img class="po-image-two" src="images/rise/rise10.png" alt="Rise, Health App">

        <h5 class="po-subtitle">Tests</h5>
        <p class="po-text">Once we had drawn our wireframes, we tested them. We made a cognitive walkthrough for our
            main functionality and sent it to 4 other groups to gather feedback on what we might improve before making
            high-fidelity prototypes.</p>
        <img class="po-image-two" src="images/rise/rise11.png" alt="Rise, Health App">
        <p class="po-text">We conclude that the Daily Check-up achieves its purpose and is understandable and
            intuitive.<br>Although we consider the component error-free, we have added the daily input of all habits the
            user wants to control. We also made other changes and added some elements, according to the comments we
            received in the walkthrough, and we agreed to improve to provide a better product and experience.</p>

        <!-- Design -->
        <h4 class="po-subtitle">4. Design </h4>
        <img class="po-image-one" src="images/rise/rise12.png" alt="Rise, Health App">
        <img class="po-image-one" src="images/rise/rise13.png" alt="Rise, Health App">

        <h5 class="po-subtitle" style="margin-top: 80px;">Conclusion</h5>
        <p class="po-text" style="margin-bottom: 40px;">I am happy with the product we have made. I think that we
            successfully created an app that
            makes mental health monitoring more accessible. After the user testing, we are confident that Rise would be
            a satisfying experience for users.</p>
