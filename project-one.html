        <p class="po-text">We started by having a brainstorming session <b style="font-weight: 800;">to explore
                problems</b> for our project. Each team member wrote down words that came to mind on a Post-It note. We
            repeated the process several times, resulting in a few ideas. After, we observed some similarities between
            the generated ideas and decided to group them by themes.</p>
        <img class="po-image-two" src="images/rise2.png" alt="Rise, Health App">
        <p class="po-text">Within the themes we got, we chose to move forward with health. Since it is a theme we had
            never worked on
            before, we thought it would be a good challenge to develop our research and design thinking skills. Within

        <h4 class="po-subtitle">1. Research</h4>
        <p class="po-text">In recent years, there has been increasing acknowledgment of the importance of mental health
